Hi,

I'm Tim Pinoy. I'm passionate about data, technology, gaming, metal music, anime/manga, and science fiction.

After nearly a decade in North America, I returned to Belgium in 2019, bringing with me a wealth of diverse experiences. Professionally, I am a pre-sales consultant specializing in regulatory reporting and risk software. My background includes several years as a consultant setting up and integrating financial software.

This blog is a space for me to share my random thoughts and insights. Expect the content will be extremely sporadic.

Thank you for visiting!

# About this site

I decided to set up a blog after watching [Get Involved!](https://getinvolved.hanselman.com/) by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) & [Rob Conery](https://rob.conery.io/)
