My name is Tim Pinoy. I am a pre-sales consultant for regulatory reporting and risk software. I enjoy all things related to data, technology, gaming, music and science-fiction.

After spending several years in North America I once again live in Belgium where I mainly work from home.

This blog will mainly consist of my own thoughts and scribbles.

# About this site

I decided to set up a blog after watching [Get Involved!](https://getinvolved.hanselman.com/) by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) & [Rob Conery](https://rob.conery.io/)
